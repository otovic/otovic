### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Petar and I am a Full Stack Developer, I specialize in crafting web applications using JavaScript (React, Node.js), Python, and Java. My passion for mobile development led me to explore Flutter, resulting in the successful release of an app on the Google Play Store. Currently, I'm further expanding my mobile expertise through learning React Native. With a focus on creating visually stunning and intuitive applications, I have hands-on experience in developing fully functional websites. From conceptualization to deployment and beyond, I have actively participated in all aspects of the website and mobile development lifecycle. Driven by a strong desire to expand my knowledge and stay updated with the latest technologies, I consistently seek opportunities to learn and grow.
